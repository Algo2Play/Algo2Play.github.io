## 2021
- FRAX v.2 launched in Q4 2021 and introducing Algorithmic Market Operations controllers (AMOs) lead to increased adoption, causing FRAX supply to increase x7 fold to c.$3.6bn FRAX since ([DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/frax)).

This figure (c.$3.6bn) counts liquidity as the Collateral USDC on all AMOs, USDC pools, FRAX3CRV and FEI3CRVs through their Contracts. Staking includes governance tokens staked in the protocol. Pool2 includes staked LP tokens where one of the coins in the pair is the governance token. Borrows includes borrowed coins in lending protocols.
